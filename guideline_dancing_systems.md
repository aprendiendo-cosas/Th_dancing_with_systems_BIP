## Objectives 

The ultimate goal of this session is to connect with the idea of a complex system from a more diffuse and fluid perspective than when we study its composition and structure. The idea is that we learn to use the concept of complex systems to address the problems involved in ecosystem management. To do this, we will rely on the personal experience of Donella Meadows. She was a researcher who dedicated her career to studying how complex systems work. She initially used a mechanistic approach, but she eventually realized that this approach was flawed. She then coined the term "dancing with systems." This term encompasses a series of best practices that are useful for addressing the problems that arise when working with complex systems. In other words, complex or wicked problems. Additionally, in this teaching act, we study the philosophical foundations of the methodology we use to tackle the complex challenges associated with various types of socio-ecosystems.

## Contents
This session is a summary of [this](https://donellameadows.org/archives/dancing-with-systems/) article. In turn, this article is a summary of the book titled "[Thinking in Systems](https://github.com/aprendiendo-cosas/Th_dancing_with_systems_BIP/raw/refs/tags/2024_2025/biblio/Meadows-2008.-Thinking-in-Systems.pdf)" by the same author. 

Although the content is self-explanatory, I am providing [here](https://github.com/aprendiendo-cosas/Th_dancing_with_systems_BIP/raw/refs/tags/2024_2025/presentation/dancing_with_systems.pptx) a presentation with the key ideas.
